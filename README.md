# Overview

Covid19 is getting worse everyday and It now becomes World Pandemic. So many talented people spent 
so much time for making good web applications 
and infographic such as graphs, images, and videos to deliver information and awareness to the people.
Pandemic20 is an interactive infographic which combines the benefits of web application & static infographic. 
I want users to be active participants of the timeline; thus, users are able to
- start & pause the timeline
- pick the specific date
- see the detailed information about the certain country by clicking on the map

Also, the data is fetched periodically every 10 - 15 minutes and updated automatically.

I hope you like my first opensource project and I really appreciate for all Health professionals and anyone who is at the front of the line.
